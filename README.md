# SEAL
Systematic Error Analysis and Labeling (SEAL) is an interactive tool for discovering systematic errors in NLP models via clustering on high-loss example groups and semantic labeling for interpretability of those error-groups. It supports fine-grained analytical visualization for interactively zooming into potential systematic bugs and features for crafting prompts to label those bugs semantically.
